# Bad Domains
A Filter for uBO that blocks internet garbage

___

### Filters
**Speed Up** Focuses on website speed. If you're on a slow connection or a limited data plan, then this filter is for you. We accelerate the pages for you with a few rules.

**Lite** is for really low end computers that can barely handle any filters, I have focused on making it more based on patterns that most trackers share in common, rather than using a big domain list.
The **Lite** filter can break some sites in exchange for the minimal ram footprint.
The **Lite** filter can be combined with different filters since it blocks what most other filters forget.

**Exploits** blocks a few patterns that some old school exploit kits followed. (Not recommended)

**Domains** (OUTDATED) is like the usual filters you've seen before. It has got a list of tracking domains that it blocks.

**Fuck off filters** (OUTDATED) focuses on blocking as many tracking attempts as possible, in exchange of breaking most sites.

**Crawled** (OUTDATED) is a compilation of crawled filters that we've found while crawling the web for trackers

### Coming soon

**Phishing** is a list of known phishing domains that is update regularly.

**Exploits** aims at defending against XSS'es and 0day exploits.
