# Bad Domains
A Filter for uBO that blocks internet garbage

I have got several versions of it [Lite / Domains, so far]

___

### Filters

**Lite** is for really low end computers that can barely handle any filters, I haved focused on making it more based on patterns that most trackers have in common, rather than using a big domain list.
The **Lite** filter can break some sites in exchange for the minimal ram footprint.

**Domains** is like the usual filters you've seen before. It has got a list of tracking domains that it blocks.

### Coming soon

**Phishing** is a list of known phishing domains that is update regularly.

**Fuck off Google** focuses on blocking as many Google tracking attempts as possible, in exchange of breaking some sites.
