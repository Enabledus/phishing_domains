# Bad Domains
A Filter for uBO that blocks internet garbage

___

### Filters
**Privacy** Focuses on website privacy. It blocks junk from sites, such as visitor analytics and trackers.

**Lite** is for really low end computers that can barely handle any filters, I have focused on making it more based on patterns that most trackers share in common, rather than using a big domain list.
The **Lite** filter can break some sites in exchange for the minimal ram footprint.
The **Lite** filter can be combined with different filters since it blocks what most other filters forget.

**Exploits** blocks a few patterns that some old school exploit kits followed. (Not recommended)

**Domains** (OUTDATED) is like the usual filters you've seen before. It has got a list of tracking domains that it blocks.
